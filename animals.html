        <h1>IMPORTANCE OF ANIMALS</h1>
        <br>
        <p>All terrestrial organisms are interconnected; the plants affect the animals, and vice versa. Terrestrial ecosystems derive their initial energy from the sun. Plants capture the energy in sunlight and convert it to chemical energy by the process of photosynthesis. Accordingly, ecologists call plants “producers.” During photosynthesis, plants also produce oxygen that the planet’s animals need to survive.
            Herbivores, which ecologists call “consumers,” benefit from the oxygen produced by the plants as well as the food they represent. These primary consumers control the population of many plant species and help disperse the seeds or help to pollinate the various plants. Predators, which ecologists call “secondary consumers,” eat these animals. These predators help control the predation pressure on the plants by limiting the number of primary consumers. Once the consumers die, and the species that ecologists call “decomposers” begin breaking down the animals, nutrients are released into the soil that plants use for growth.</p>

        <h1>SAVING ANIMALS</h1>
        <br>
        <p>There are more than 7 billion people on Earth. If every one of us committed to do one thing — no matter how small — to protect wildlife every day, then even minor actions can have a major impact when we all work together</p>
        <p>We should find new ways to use things we already own. If we can’t reuse, then recycle.
            Unnecessary killing of wild birds and animals, whether they are in abundance, should not be allowed anywhere. National Parks and Sanctuaries should be established in more numbers for preserving the natural habitats of wild animals and birds throughout the country.
            We should try not to purchase products made from endangered animals or their parts; We can stop wildlife trafficking from being a profitable enterprise.
            Ivory and similar items are almost always obtained by poaching, which is an extremely harmful industry which involves the maiming or even killing of animals. Items such as ivory should not – under any circumstances – be purchased.
            Planting trees really is one of the most effective things we can do to help with preserving natural habitats.
            We should try to keep our home and land wildlife-friendly by ensuring that it is kept clean and waste is kept secure.
            Support bans on cruel sport and activities such as trapping and harassing. The stress caused by such activities – as well as the activities themselves quite often – can be lethal to animals in need of support.
            Spiders are another important part of the natural order, so even if you find yourself scared by them, resist the urge to kill them. Spiders help to control the population of flies, mosquitoes, and other such pests, and so they are a real boon to most households. Either leave them be or take them outside.
            Love nature and love its creation. It will automatically drive you to contribute to their conservation.
