        <h2>Importance of Trees</h2>
        <br>
        <p> Today, many trees are brought down by people to build streets, houses, manufacturing plants, and so on.
            Trees assume a significant job in nature. They clean air and give oxygen supply.
            Planting trees won’t just make up for their loss yet, also advantage the earth.
            Trees are the earth’s life supportive network. They support and are essential for life on earth.
            Aside from giving oxygen, trees additionally work as common safeguards of noise pollution.
            The forests do develop naturally. Be that as it may, today, forests are chopped down at a rate more noteworthy than they could develop.
            This causes a sort of irregularity, wherein relatively few trees are left to meet our oxygen supply and different requirements.
            Trees are a source of shelter and nourishment for many species, reptiles, and birds.
            Any place a tree is planted it gives another lease of life to these species. Trees additionally cause rain and prevent floods.

        <h2> Saving Trees</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Trees are a natural resource. They are a treasure and we must protect them.
            Trees help in maintaining the ecological balance of ecosystems on earth. If we destroy trees we destroy ourselves.
            In the process of photosynthesis in trees, carbon dioxide is used up and oxygen is released into the air.
            This helps in keeping a constant and abundant supply of oxygen in the air, and helps life forms to breathe.
            If there is no oxygen to breathe in we cannot live. So our life depends on trees.
            Trees also keep down the heat on Earth. If there are no trees the heat on the planet will be intolerable.
            Besides, due to large amounts of heat created due to factors such as the smoke generated from industries and vehicular traffic there is global warming resulting in climate change.
            Trees can help in solving this big crisis. Trees should therefore be saved.
